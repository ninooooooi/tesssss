**Domain :** Machine Learning / AI

**Problem Name :** Build Mathematical model using ML and signal processing concept to process the skin issues into dryness and oiliness.

**Description :** Patients face a lot of problems with their skin. The main issue remains with the type of skin they have. 
Depending on the type of skin various skin diseases can occur. So if the skin is too dry it may start to peel and lead to various skin diseases like 
Psoriasis, Eczema etc. likewise too oily skin can lead to pimples which in turn can lead to scars. So the identification of skin type is of utmost need.
